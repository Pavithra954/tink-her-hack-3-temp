### Project Description
This is a local community helper designed to bring everything a neighborhood needs under one roof. Key features include waste management, event organization, donations, and much more...(we will add more in future :) )

### The Problem statement
Local communities often face challenges in maintaining cleanliness, efficiently managing donations, and staying informed about events that promote social welfare and engagement. Despite the availability of resources, there is a lack of an organized and accessible platform to address these issues, leading to inefficient waste management, mismatched donations, and missed opportunities for community participation.
